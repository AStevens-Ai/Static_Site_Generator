# Welcome to My Static HTML Site Generator

Hello everyone! This is my static HTML site generator. It takes a Markdown file, much like this one, and creates a page out of it in static HTML!

## How to Use

1. Replace the root directories `/content` directory index.md file,  with a file ending in the extension `.md` that contains all the Markdown youâ€™d like to render on the page.
2. Simply run: `./main.sh` in the root directory.

   

# Its that easy.
